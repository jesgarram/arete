# Presentations

## Key Concepts

Effective presentations balance narrative structure with visual clarity. The audience decides whether to care in the first 30 seconds. Each slide must advance a single story arc - setup, conflict, resolution. Death by bullet points is real. The best presentations feel like conversations, not lectures. Visuals should carry meaning without text explanation.

## Questions

- Who is the skeptic in the room? What's their incentive to say no?
- What must they do or feel after this? Buy-in, approval, action, understanding?
- What's the medium? Formal slides, whiteboard session, demo-heavy, or discussion?
- Why is this urgent now? What's the cost of waiting?
- What's the one thing they must remember if they forget everything else?
- Can you start with the failure or problem instead of the solution?
- What if there were no text - only visuals? What would you show?
- What's the emotional arc? Fear → relief? Confusion → clarity? Boredom → excitement?
- Do they need to understand how it works or just believe it will work?
- What objection will surface first? Can you preempt it?
- Are you asking for permission, buy-in, or just sharing information?
- What's the follow-up action? Clear next step or open-ended discussion?
