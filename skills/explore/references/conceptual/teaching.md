# Teaching

## Key Concepts

Effective teaching builds on what learners already know. Start with concrete examples before abstract principles. Active learning beats passive listening. Immediate feedback accelerates understanding. Cognitive load matters - don't overload working memory. The best teachers make the implicit explicit. Assessment should drive learning, not just measure it.

## Questions

- Who are the learners? Beginners, intermediate, or mixed skill levels?
- What do they already know? Where's the edge of their understanding?
- What must they be able to do at the end? Build something, explain a concept, or make decisions?
- What's the format? Workshop, course, tutorial, mentoring session, or self-paced?
- How long do you have? One session or multiple over time?
- Can they practice immediately or is it theory-only?
- What's the hardest concept they'll struggle with? How do you scaffold it?
- Do you start with examples or principles? Concrete then abstract or vice versa?
- How do you check understanding along the way? Questions, exercises, or demonstrations?
- What common misconceptions exist in this domain?
- Can you use analogies or metaphors to bridge to their existing knowledge?
- What's the follow-up support? Resources, exercises, or just this one session?
