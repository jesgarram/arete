# Writing

## Key Concepts

Technical writing prioritizes clarity over cleverness. Structure comes before sentences - outline the argument before worrying about prose. The reader is always skeptical and busy. Every paragraph needs a job. Examples beat abstractions. Passive voice hides responsibility. The best technical writing teaches without the reader noticing they're learning.

## Questions

- Who is the reader? Their technical level, motivation, and time constraints?
- What must they be able to do after reading? Make a decision, implement something, or just understand?
- What's the medium? Blog post, documentation, RFC, memo, or tutorial?
- What's the one thing they should remember? Can you state it in one sentence?
- Are you explaining, persuading, or instructing? What's the primary goal?
- What do they already know? Where does their knowledge end and yours begin?
- Can you show instead of tell? What examples make the concept concrete?
- What's the structure? Problem-solution, chronological, concept-then-example?
- Do you need a TL;DR or executive summary at the top?
- What terminology will confuse them? What needs definition upfront?
- Where will they get bored? What can you cut or move to an appendix?
- What objection or confusion will surface first? Can you address it early?
