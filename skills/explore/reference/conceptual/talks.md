# Talks

## Key Concepts

Stage presence beats perfect content. The audience forgives stumbles but not boredom. Live talks require energy, pacing, and audience interaction - they're performances, not readings. The first 60 seconds determine if they'll pay attention. Stories beat statistics. Pauses are powerful. Memorize the opening and closing, improvise the middle.

## Questions

- Who's in the room? Technical experts, business folks, mixed audience?
- What's the venue? Conference keynote, internal tech talk, workshop, panel?
- How long do you have? 5 minutes, 20 minutes, or full hour?
- What energy level does the slot demand? Opening keynote (high energy) or after-lunch (need to wake them up)?
- Can you use live demos or is it too risky? What's the backup plan?
- What's the hook in the first 60 seconds? Question, story, bold claim, or surprising stat?
- Do you need audience interaction? Q&A, polls, exercises, or just listen?
- What's the room layout? Theater style, classroom, roundtable?
- Will there be questions during or only at the end?
- What's the one story that makes your point unforgettable?
- How do you want them to feel? Inspired, informed, challenged, entertained?
- What's the call to action? Try something, think differently, or just understand?
