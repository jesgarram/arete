# Outline Template (Conceptual Track)

For non-technical brainstorm sessions. Structure flows naturally from brainstorm content.

## Required Sections
- Audience (who, what they know, what they care about)
- Objective (think/feel/do after)

## Template

```markdown
---
problem: "..."
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# [Title]

**Audience**: [Who, background, concerns]
**Objective**: [Desired outcome]

[Sections flow from brainstorm - no rigid template]
```

## Naming Convention
- Outline: `[problem-slug]-outline-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Location: `context/exports/`
- Single file per session
