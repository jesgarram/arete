## Key Concepts

Stage presence matters more than slides. Silence is powerful - use it. The audience remembers stories, not facts. Energy is contagious, positive or negative. Practice with a timer - going over is disrespectful.

## Refinement Questions

- What's your opening line? Does it grab attention or waste it?
- Can you deliver the core message without any slides? Test this
- What's the one story that will stick? Is it human and specific?
- Have you timed the full talk? What gets cut when you're running long?
- Where are the planned pauses? Silence after key points lands them
- What's your recovery plan when tech fails? Know your talk cold
- How do you handle the hostile question? Prepare your non-defensive responses
- What's the energy arc? Where do you raise and lower intensity?
- Can you see faces or are you reading slides? Make eye contact points
- What's the callback to the opening in your close? Bookend the talk
