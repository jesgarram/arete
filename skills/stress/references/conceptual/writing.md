# Writing

## Key Concepts

Clear writing is clear thinking. Every sentence must earn its place. Jargon signals insecurity, not expertise. The reader owes you nothing - respect their time. Structure before prose: outline, then fill.

## Refinement Questions

- What's the single thesis? Can you state it in one sentence?
- Who is the reader? What do they know? What do they fear?
- What's the one thing they should do after reading? Is it explicit?
- Can you cut the first paragraph and lose nothing? Often you can
- Have you stripped all corporate jargon? "Leverage", "synergy", "utilize" must die
- Is every section necessary? What happens if you remove it?
- Does the structure reveal itself? Headers should tell the story alone
- Are you explaining or proving? Show evidence, not assertions
- What's the reading time? Is that respectful of your audience?
- Have you read it aloud? Awkward prose reveals itself when spoken
