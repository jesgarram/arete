## Key Concepts

Learning happens through doing, not listening. Confusion precedes understanding - don't resolve it too quickly. Examples before abstractions. Progressive complexity builds confidence. The curse of knowledge is real - you've forgotten what you didn't know.

## Refinement Questions

- What's the prerequisite knowledge? Have you tested learners have it?
- What can they DO after this that they couldn't before? Be specific
- Is there a hands-on exercise within the first 10 minutes? Learning is active
- What's the most common misconception? How do you preempt it?
- Are examples before or after theory? Flip them - examples first
- What's the difficulty curve? Where do people drop off?
- Do you have checkpoints to verify understanding before moving on?
- What's the reference material for after? Learning continues beyond the session
- How do you handle the expert who already knows this? Boredom kills energy
- What's the one thing they'll remember in a month? Build everything around it
