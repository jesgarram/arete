# Presentations

## Key Concepts

The audience decides whether to care in the first 30 seconds. Each slide must advance a single story arc. Death by bullet points is real. The best presentations feel like conversations, not lectures. Visuals should carry meaning without text explanation.

## Refinement Questions

- What's the "villain" (problem) that creates tension? Is it vivid enough?
- What's the "hero" (solution)? Does it feel inevitable after the setup?
- If they forget everything else, what single sentence must they remember?
- Can you remove any slide and the story still works? Then remove it
- Are you starting with the problem or jumping to the solution? Start with pain
- What's the skeptic's first objection? Have you preempted it?
- Can you replace bullet points with one powerful image per slide?
- Does Slide 3 make Slide 4 inevitable? Check every transition
- What's the emotional arc? Fear → relief? Confusion → clarity?
- What's the specific ask at the end? Vague asks get vague responses
